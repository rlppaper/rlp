Cube
<p>
Roll the cube around the grid, picking up the blue squares on its
faces. Try to get all the blue squares on to the object at the same
time, in as few moves as possible.
<p>
Use the arrow keys to roll the cube, or click the mouse where you
want it to roll towards. After every roll, the grid square and cube
face that you brought into contact swap their colours, so that a
non-blue cube face can pick up a blue square, but a blue face rolled
on to a non-blue square puts it down again.
<p>
When you have mastered the cube, use the Type menu to select other
regular solids!
