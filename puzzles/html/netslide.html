Netslide
<p>
Slide the grid squares around so that they all join up into a single
connected network with no loops.
<p>
Click on the arrows at the edges of the grid to move a row or column
left, right, up or down. The square that falls off the end of the
row comes back on the other end.
<p>
Squares connected to the middle square are lit up. Aim to light up
every square in the grid (not just the endpoint blobs).
<p>
Connecting across a red barrier line is forbidden. On harder levels,
there are fewer barriers, which makes it harder rather than easier!
