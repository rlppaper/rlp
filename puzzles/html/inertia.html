Inertia
<p>
Slide the ball around the grid picking up the gems. Every time the
ball moves, it will keep sliding until it either hits a wall, or
stops on a stop square (the broken circles). Try to collect every
gem without running into any of the mines.
<p>
Use the numeric keypad to slide the ball horizontally, vertically or
diagonally. Alternatively, click on the grid to make the ball move
towards where you clicked.
<p>
If you hit a mine and explode, you can select Undo from the Game
menu and continue playing; the game will track how many times you
died.
