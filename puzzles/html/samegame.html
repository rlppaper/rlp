Same Game
<p>
Try to empty the playing area completely, by removing connected
groups of two or more squares of the same colour. Then try to score
as much as possible, by removing large groups at a time instead of
small ones.
<p>
Click on a coloured square to highlight the rest of its connected
group. The status line will print the number of squares selected,
and the score you would gain by removing them. Click again to remove
the group; other squares will fall down to fill the space, and if
you empty a whole column then the other columns will move up. You
cannot remove a single isolated square: try to avoid dead-end
positions where all remaining squares are isolated.
